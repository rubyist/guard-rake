# Guard::Rake

Guard::Rake allows you to automatically run a Rake task when files are
modified.

## Install

Please be sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) installed
before continuing.

Install the gem:
```bash
$ gem install guard-rake```

Add it to your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'guard-rake'
```

Add the default Guard::Rake template to your `Guardfile` by running this
command:

```bash
$ guard init rake
```

## Usage

Please read the [Guard usage documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

## Guardfile

Guard::Rake comes with a default template that looks like this:

```ruby
guard 'rake', :task => 'doit' do
  watch(%r{^some_files/.+$})
end
```

This will run the rake task `doit` from your `Rakefile` whenever any of
the watched files change.

### List of available options:

``` ruby
:task => 'doit'              # name of the task to be executed, required
:run_on_all => false         # runs when the 'run_all' signal is received from Guard (enter is pressed), default: true
:run_on_start => true        # runs when guard is started, default: true
:run_each => true            # runs rake task with each modified path as the argument, default: true
:no_args => true             # runs rake task without passing arguments to the rake task, default: true
```
